# NOTE:
I am creating an npm package called `supabase-kit` for more general use. This Repository has been archived.

# Overview

### Introduction

This is an AuthKit built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), designed for **production-ready use**. It includes basic UI elements provided with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Authentication is handled through both Password-based and OAuth methods, following the PKCE flow.

By synchronizing app logic with Supabase settings in a single file, authentication can be managed flexibly and consistently.

### Teck stacks

- TypeScript
- Next.js 14 (React 18) using App Router
- Supabase
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI
- Zod

### Why Next.js 14?

Many packages do not yet support React 19, so I plan to upgrade to Next.js 15 when the timing is appropriate. Apart from asynchronously loading cookies() and searchParams, there are no significant differences in this AuthKit.

### Changelog

**_[ 2024-12-12 ]_**

I have been developing my personal projects using a feature-based folder structure, so I adjusted the folder structure accordingly. In my personal opinion, it is more intuitive and scalable.

**_[ 2024-10-31 ]_**

Updated CSS styling to use shadcn defaults for a more primitive kit setup. Renamed folders and files and refactored code for a more understandable structure.

# Folder and file structure
